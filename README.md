# http://mygeocaching.wz.cz
This website is my small project where I used basics of HTML, JS, CSS and PHP.

## Key sections of this website
### GPS Convertor
As a geocaching player I often use GPS conversion so that I coded this JS piece to help me with conversion.

### Feedback section
This section uses simple script that can send user's feedback to my database.
